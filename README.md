# Heart-Disease_Prediction_Machine_learning
A breach of the heart's regular functions will lead to the majority of cases of heart disease. Complete cardiac arrest can be avoided by being aware of the various heart disease warning signals as soon as possible. This study suggests a method for predicting cardiac disease before symptoms appear by combining several machine learning techniques with data on body mass index, stroke risk, alcohol use, smoking habits, prior strokes, age, race, and physical activity. Six different classifiers, including Decision Tree Classifier, Extra Tress Classifier Logistics Regression,  Gaussian Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, KNNClassifier, Extra Tress Classifier and XG Boost, have been trained using these high feature attributes to predict heart disease. The F1 score has been used  to assess the best performing model and evaluate the findings instead of the use of accuracy as the dataset is an imbalanced on.  Furthermore, the proposed study has achieved 86% for the F1 score, using the Random Forest classifier. Random Forest and Extra Trees Classifier has the lowest rates of false positive and false negative results. Because of this, Random Forest and Extra Trees Classifier are essentially the best classifier for predicting heart disease with an imbalanced dataset, allowing doctors to more easily  diagnose and identify potential heart illnesses early on.
